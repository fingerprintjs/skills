description: Serve the Fingerprint JS Agent (v4) from your own domain, Fingerprint's required production setup — a first-party custom subdomain (set up by the Fingerprint CLI wizard, `fingerprint integrate --subdomain`, the `fingerprint subdomains` commands, or the dashboard) or a proxy integration (Cloudflare, CloudFront, Azure Front Door, Akamai, Fastly), configured through the v4 `endpoints` option. Use after basic identification works, when identification is unreliable, short-lived or missing for some visitors in production.

# Fingerprint — First-party deployment (custom subdomain / proxy)

Fingerprint's production setup serves the JS Agent from **your own domain**, through a custom
subdomain or a proxy integration. The docs call this **required for correct identification**. By
default the agent loads from, and sends requests to, Fingerprint's domain, a third-party context
for your site. Browsers restrict third-party storage (Safari's ITP, Firefox's ETP, storage
partitioning generally), so identification from that context is shorter-lived and inconsistent,
and for some visitors it fails outright, which means no fraud check runs for them. Serving the
agent first-party fixes this. In the dashboard this step is listed under *Protect against ad
blockers*.

## Scope and consent
This changes **where requests go**, not what you are allowed to collect. It is for a site you
operate, and it does not reduce any disclosure obligation you already have.

- Use it only on **domains you own or operate**, to identify visitors to *that* site.
- Keep it purpose-limited to **security, fraud prevention and abuse detection**. It is not a
  mechanism for advertising, ad targeting, audience building, or profiling people across sites you
  don't control.
- **Disclose device identification in your privacy notice**, and obtain consent where the law that
  applies to your users requires it (e.g. GDPR/ePrivacy, CCPA/CPRA). Moving the endpoint to your
  own domain does not change this; confirm the specifics with whoever owns privacy compliance at
  your company.
- **Honour opt-outs and deletion requests.** Don't use first-party deployment to re-identify
  someone who has opted out, or to work around a choice a user has expressed.

> **This API changed in v4.** The old `scriptUrlPattern`, `endpoint` (singular), `tlsEndpoint`, and
> `disableTls` options were **removed** and consolidated into a single **`endpoints`** option.

## Pick one approach

| Approach | Who runs it | Effort | Pick it when |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Custom subdomain** | Fingerprint, behind DNS records on your domain | Low: three DNS records | Default. Any plan. Set up from the CLI or the dashboard. |
| **Proxy integration** | You, at your edge (Cloudflare on any plan; CloudFront, Azure Front Door, Akamai, Fastly on Enterprise) | Higher: deploy and maintain a proxy | You need Safari cookie lifetime of one year instead of seven days, IPv6, unlimited subdomains and paths, or WAF/logging on identification traffic |

Never set up both for the same app. Both change only where the agent loads its script from and the
`endpoints` value, not your application logic, so you can start with a subdomain and move to a
proxy later.

## The v4 `endpoints` option
- `endpoints` sets where the agent **sends identification requests**. It takes a single string
  (your subdomain/proxy origin); an array can be supplied when fallbacks are required.
- The **script download URL** is set separately:
  - **CDN**: it's the import URL — `https://metrics.yourdomain.com/web/v4/<PUBLIC_API_KEY>`. Note
    the `/web/` segment: on your own host the agent download sits under that prefix, while
    Fingerprint's CDN serves it at `https://fpjscdn.net/v4/<PUBLIC_API_KEY>` with no prefix. So
    routing an existing CDN import through a subdomain means adding `/web/`, not just swapping the
    host. (Passing `endpoints` to the npm/SDK path appends `/web/` for you.)
  - **NPM / framework SDKs**: pass `endpoints` to the provider/start options (e.g. the
    `FingerprintProvider` `endpoints` prop). See `snippets/subdomain-options.js`.
- If the site has a Content Security Policy, add the subdomain or proxy origin to `connect-src`.

## Custom subdomain

A subdomain is usable only at server status `active`. Creating it, adding its DNS records, and
even all records reading `validated` are not enough. Only `active` permits setting `endpoints` or
switching the script URL. DNS and certificate issuance take minutes to hours (the docs allow up to
24 hours), so a pending setup ends the run with a clear next step, never a polling loop.

There are three equal ways to register the subdomain and get its DNS records. They all create the
same resource in the same workspace, so a subdomain started in one place can be finished in
another: the CLI wizard, the `fingerprint subdomains` commands, or the dashboard. Use whichever
the user is already in; if they have created one in the dashboard, do not create another.

### The CLI wizard

The `npx fingerprint` wizard offers this step once identification works. To start it directly, or
to pick up a pending one where it stopped:

```bash
npx fingerprint integrate --subdomain metrics.yourdomain.com
```

The CLI asks for the hostname (it never guesses one), looks it up in the workspace and creates it
if missing, prints the DNS records, and offers **Check the DNS records now** (each check waits up
to five minutes for propagation), **Show the DNS records again**, or **Finish later**. Once the
subdomain is `active` it points the app at it: the agent edits the provider options, and the CLI
writes the endpoint variable to the frontend's env file itself. A pending setup is remembered per
project, and the next `fingerprint integrate` run offers to resume it. With `--ci` or `--yes` the
CLI prints the records and the resume command and exits without prompting.

**When you are the agent running inside the wizard**, you have four tools on the `fingerprint`
server. The CLI holds the session, so you never see or ask for a Management API key.

| Tool | Input | Returns |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `list_subdomains` | none | `subdomains[]`: `id`, `subdomain`, `status`, `created_at`, `updated_at` |
| `get_subdomain` | `{ id }` | `subdomain` with `dns_records` |
| `create_subdomain` | `{ hostname }` | the created `subdomain` with `dns_records` |
| `verify_subdomain` | `{ id }` | runs one DNS check, then re-reads and returns the fresh `subdomain` |

Follow the CLI's prompt: list first, create only the hostname the CLI named and only if it is not
there, and while it is pending change no code and keep your report to a sentence or two. The CLI
prints the records and the next step itself. Once active, reference the env variable the CLI
names in the provider options and stop; the CLI writes it. There is no delete tool: deleting is a
user decision made through the command below or in the dashboard.

### The `fingerprint subdomains` commands

The same operations as commands, for an agent with a shell or a user at a terminal. Sign in once
with `fingerprint login`; the CLI keeps a workspace-scoped key in the user's config directory and
the commands read it. Every command accepts the hostname or the `certv2_…` id and `--json`.

```bash
fingerprint subdomains                                  # list, plus the available commands
fingerprint subdomains create metrics.yourdomain.com    # register; prints the DNS records
fingerprint subdomains list
fingerprint subdomains get    metrics.yourdomain.com    # status + DNS records, no side effects
fingerprint subdomains verify metrics.yourdomain.com    # one on-demand DNS check, then fresh status
fingerprint subdomains delete metrics.yourdomain.com    # prompts; --yes required with --json or --ci
```

Errors come back as `{ kind, message }` (plus `violations` or `retry_after` when present). Surface
them and stop; they are already actionable:

| `kind` | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `not_authenticated` | run `fingerprint login` |
| `invalid_subdomain` | the returned `violations` say what to change |
| `duplicate` | the hostname exists; resolve it with `get` instead |
| `not_found` / `ambiguous` | no match / several match; use `list` and pick by id |
| `limit_reached` | 50 subdomains per workspace, 5 on a free trial |
| `rate_limited` | the API allows one verify per minute; wait `retry_after` |
| `confirmation_required` | `delete` needs `--yes` in `--json` or `--ci` runs |
| `unavailable` / `api_error` | service unavailable or unexpected; report and stop |

Never retry in a loop, never delete to make room, never ask the user to paste a key, and never
call the Management API over raw HTTP from a skill run.

### The dashboard

The user registers the subdomain and adds the records themselves, and you do the code. This is
the only path with one-click DNS setup:

1. **Settings → Subdomains → New subdomain**, enter the hostname (or open the existing one).
2. Add the records the dashboard shows at the DNS provider, all at once (**Copy all records** is
   zone-file format). On Cloudflare DNS the dashboard offers **one-click setup** via Domain
   Connect; either way the records must be **DNS only** (proxying off), and CNAME flattening off.
3. **Check DNS records**, then wait for the status to read **Active**.
4. Only then apply [How to apply](#how-to-apply-code-side). Ask the user to confirm **Active**
   before editing.

### Choosing the hostname

Confirm the exact hostname with the user before creating anything: subdomains are immutable, so
changing one means deleting and recreating it. Constraints, enforced by the API:

- A subdomain of the site the app runs on (e.g. `metrics.yourdomain.com` for `yourdomain.com`),
  never the site's own hostname (its A records will point at Fingerprint) and never a subdomain
  of some other domain the user owns: that is not first-party for this site.
- A valid FQDN, at most 64 characters, not containing `fingerprint` (case-insensitive). The docs
  also advise against `fp`. Use a neutral name such as `metrics`.
- 50 per workspace, 5 on a free trial.

### DNS records

`dns_records` holds `verification` (one CNAME, proves ownership), `routing[]` (two A records,
carry the traffic) and, when the domain has a conflicting CAA record, `caa`. Each has `type`,
`host`, `value` and its own `status` (`pending_validation`, `validated`, `failed`). Show all of
them together: they are added in one pass, and the A records do not wait for the certificate. The
user adds them at their DNS provider, which may not be their web host; if you have an authorized
DNS-provider tool, offer to apply exactly these records after the user approves.

### Branch on status

Status comes from the server, never from elapsed time or from the records.

| Status | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `pending` | Leave `endpoints` and code untouched. Name the records still `pending_validation`; when all are `validated`, say certificate issuance is in progress. End as waiting: no polling, no second verify. Report hostname, id, what is outstanding, and the resume command. |
| `active` | Configure the endpoint (below). |
| `timed_out` | Records were not validated within 14 days. Offer to delete and recreate the same hostname; both need explicit approval. Then present the new records. |
| `failed` | Records were found but the certificate cannot be issued, almost always a conflicting CAA record. Show the `caa` record to add; once it has propagated, delete and recreate. Both need approval. |

Get Started step 3 stays open while the subdomain is anything but `active`.

### Configure only after `active`

Follow [How to apply](#how-to-apply-code-side). Inside the wizard, reference the env variable the
CLI names and stop; the CLI writes it. Elsewhere, never read or print `.env`; if you cannot write
the env file, give the user the exact variable and value. For a CDN install, switch the import URL
and `endpoints` directly. Keep the public key and region as they are.

## Proxy integration
1. Deploy one of Fingerprint's proxy integrations at your edge: **Cloudflare** (dashboard wizard,
   any plan), **AWS CloudFront**, **Azure Front Door**, **Akamai**, **Fastly VCL** or **Fastly
   Compute** (integration guides, Enterprise). It forwards a path on your domain to Fingerprint
   with your proxy secret.
2. Create the **proxy secret** (an API key of type `proxy`) in the dashboard and configure it in
   the proxy.
3. Set `endpoints` to your proxy origin. Same code shape as the subdomain case; only the URL
   differs. Host the proxy on the same registrable domain as the site, and on the same cloud
   provider where you can: Safari limits cookie lifetime when the site and proxy IP ranges differ.

## How to apply (code side)
- The only code change is in the **provider/start options** where you already pass the public key
  and region: add `endpoints` pointing at your subdomain/proxy. See `snippets/subdomain-options.js`.
- Keep the value in an env var named `FINGERPRINT_ENDPOINTS` with the same client prefix the public
  key uses (`NEXT_PUBLIC_`, `NUXT_PUBLIC_`, `VITE_`). That is the variable the CLI writes, so
  dev/staging/prod can differ without code edits.
- Region still must match the workspace region.
- Verify in the browser devtools Network tab that agent requests now go to **your** domain and
  return 200.

## Best practices
- Prefer the subdomain for a fast first step; move to a proxy when you want to own the edge.
- Don't expose the proxy secret to the browser; it lives only in your edge proxy config.
- If a request to your subdomain/proxy fails, the agent can fall back to Fingerprint's default
  endpoints; still handle identify errors so the flow degrades gracefully.
- Deleting an `active` subdomain stops its traffic immediately; repoint the agent first.
- Point the subdomain at your own infrastructure only. Don't route another party's traffic through
  it, and don't reuse it for anything beyond the identification described in your privacy notice.
